## Story

### 

Brief History

**Generalmusic** (established in 1987 as an Italian musical instrument manufacturing company), launched in 1990, the GEM WS2 initially proved to create some very mixed feelings with musicians (and music shops), due to the innovative (even futuristic), features, along with 128 programmable and excellent voices, including the multi-sampled Grand Piano (with 3 dynamic levels).

GEM S3 Synthesiser

Branching out into the professional synthesisers in 1992 with the GEM S2 and S3. The S2 was a 61-note keyboard and the S3 was 76-note keyboard. They did release the S4 88 note version but this was a special.

Both the S2 and S3 models had an excellent semi-weighted keyboard complete with touch/release velocity, polyphonic aftertouch and metal contacts. The front panel included seven programmable sliders, seven programmable buttons and Pitch and Modulation wheels. All functions were logically and clearly displayed on a large graphical LCD with light blue neon back-lighting.

Whilst these synthesisers gained an enormous Worldwide following (even to this day), in part due to the excellent depth of sound quality, performances, DSP effects, resonant filters (Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, Parameter Cut, or Parameter Boost), and multi-samples, two oscillators per voice, they did lack polyphony (16-note polyphonic), and some other nice to have options.

GEM S Series Advert

Generalmusic listened and shortly after, an upgraded version, aptly named S2 Turbo, S3 Turbo, was released in 1994. This added many new features and improvements such as:

-   Tone generation: variable oscillator assignment options, two new operating modes (dual oscillator and single oscillator)
-   Polyphony: max. 32 voices
-   Sounds: 500 sounds and 100 ROM performances
-   SRAM (2MB = 4 x 4 Mbit (512K x 8bit) -Battery Backed)
-   Sequencer: the sounds can be edited while the sequence is running, LFO can be synchronized with MIDI clock
-   Internal memory: A battery-backed RAM disk can be set up (with additional memory modules)
-   Sample features: Sample Translator integrated into the operating system, import of samples in many formats, Akai multisamples are read (no sound data)
-   MIDI: Compatible with the GM and Roland GS standards

The S Series gained such an incredible foot hold in the music industry, from home players, music studios, bands and the music trade support - Worldwide. When we think back, armed with the knowledge of what can be achieved in todays technology, GEM were definitely at the forefront of musical instrument innovation.

This did leave the original S2 and S3 owners, whom just bought their new keyboard synthesiser a year earlier, in frustrated limbo. So, without further ado, GEM released a retro-fit Turbokit - eveyone was then happy!

GEM continued making a large range of home, semi-professional keyboards, digital pianos and a wealth of pro audio equipment, through the sister LEM branding. Unfortunately, due to various reasons, some of which we will never know, sadly they ceased business in 2009, before becoming bankrupt in 2011.

However, the legacy of these certainly keyboards lives on!
